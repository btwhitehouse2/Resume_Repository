Readme for Resume Repository

The purpose of this compiler is to use GO and take a GO based language (please see grammar PDF for specific rules) and return a machine readable 
language. Over the course of 10 weeks I developed a working front end. That successfully lexes, parses (ensures input follow grammatical rules) and applies
semantic analysis (inputs follow logical rules of the language) and returns a token stream for intermediate language conversion. 

This compiler project represents the single largest project that I have built. It demonstrates my ability to learn a completely new programming langauge, 
GO, while completing a substantial and complex project on my own with over 2,000 lines of code and numerous design patterns most prominently the Visitor
design pattern.
