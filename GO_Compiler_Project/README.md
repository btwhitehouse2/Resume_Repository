Milestone 2 Update: 
-AST, SymbolTable and SA are implemented. Having issues with the ANTLR syntax and syncing with the grammar ie. .DECL() is not registering as a part of the *ParamatersContext class even though I have made it a part of my grammar. As a result AST will not run.
-Command line implementation is complete to run the program must be in the Golite subdirectory 
need to call % go run golite ../<the golite file that you wish to run>
